A superior and extendible Directory plugin to create beautiful location based business directories like Yelp, Tripadvisor or Yellow pages.

== Description ==

Turn your WordPress website into an interactive Business Directory!

Built based on over 3 years experience developing and supporting GeoTheme, one of the most succesful directory themes for wordpress, over one year of development and testing, GeoDirectory is finally released to the public.

= Lightweight, efficient and flexible =

GeoDirectory was developed using WordPress standards, resulting in great performances, an intuitive user interface and back end options.

= Customizable =

Hooks and filters allow developers to extend GeoDirectory infinitely, also custom themes can be easily built around GeoDirectory.  

GeoDirectory was developed to work with any theme. If you need help getting your theme working smoothly with GeoDirectory, please report any issue encountered in our [support forum](http://wpgeodirectory.com/ "Get support on wpgeodirectory.com.") and we will take action.

= Features =

* GeoDirectory allows you to create a local directory based on a single location such as a street, a neighbourhood, a city or a greater area (multi-locations addon available). 
* It provides a front end form that lets you edit through a drag and drop form builder, which allows visitors to submit their listings autonomously. 
* 12 widgets and 12 widget areas.
* 2 different Google Maps widgets with ajax loading custom markers for as many categories as you wish.
* It features a built in user reviews system, send to friend and business enquiry forms.  
* The default search widget allows you to also search by zip code or location name. Listings can be filtered by rating, reviews or date.
* Our optimized database structure allows for hundreds of thousands of businesses to be listed. 
* GeoDirectory is 100% WPML compatible for multilanguage directories.

= GDF - Directory Theme Framework =

GeoDirectory Framework was designed to be used with the GeoDirectory plugin, though it can be used without it. You can enable and disable widget areas and also style almost any area of your website from within the Framework Options Page.

It is extremely easy to build a child theme using GeoDirectory framework as a solid base foundation. We will start releasing our own child themes very soon. 

GeoDirectory Framework is 100% responsive and adapts perfectly to any device screen resolution. It also provides 2 App look-alike sliding menus.
